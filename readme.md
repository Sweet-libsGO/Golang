## Concurrency
One of the great things about GoLang is the concept of concurrency: the ability to throw all your code -- your routes, functionality, HTML templating -- all into one file and the computer will execute all of it simultaneously. GoLang basically allows programmers to create functions than can be executed at the same time as other functions. 
 
## GoRoutines 

A simple thread of execution managed by Go's runtime environment that allows multiple functions to be executed at the same time.

## Systems-oriented programming language
- Created in 2007 by Google
- More expressive, readable, consistent, robust, clean
- Main purpose is for scalability, concurrency
- YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT FORGETTING SEMICOLONS

## Installation
Just download the package manager here: https://golang.org/dl/
And learn how to use it with this Go Tour: https://tour.golang.org/list

## Code Breakdown

Although Golang is concurrent, it is still possible and most times encouraged to follow 
the familiar MVC architecture when structuring your environment. For our purposes, we decided
to keep everything tidy inside of one file.

The main file in Golang, the file that is to execute everything, starts off like so:

```
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"html/template"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
)
```

Out of the box, Go is a powerful, yet very explicit language. We can build out the things we need... Or we can keep it simple and import some packages. "package main" is telling Go that this file is where all of our files will be executed (Convention? Maybe). Here, we are also importing some other cool things that help us out big time when making a web app. 

* "encoding/json": This allows you to easily and efficiently parse JSON data.
* "html/template": Templating (Kind of like mustach√©)
* "fmt": Printing to the console.
* "io/ioutil": Provides input/output functionality
* "net/http": Possibly the coolest... Get a server up and running with only a few lines of code.

```
type Page struct {
  	Temperature int
  	Humidity int
  	Max int
  	Min int
  	Welcome string
}

type Weather struct {
	Main        string `json:"main"`
	Description string `json:"description"`
}


type Temperature struct {
	Temp     float64 `json:"temp"`
	Pressure float64 `json:"pressure"`
	Humidity float64 `json:"humidity"`
	TempMin  float64 `json:"temp_min"`
	TempMax  float64 `json:"temp_max"`
}

type Forecast struct {
	Weathers []Weather   `json:"weather"`
	Temp     Temperature `json:"main"`
}
```

**Structs** are a collection of fields that are extremely useful for grouping data together. Not quite an object, not quite a datatype... Maybe a safe place in the middle.

```
const(
    api = "13a75dbfde99048a6b499bcd9aca260b"
)
func getWeather(zip string)(*Forecast, error){
	url := fmt.Sprintf("http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=%s&APPID=%s", zip, api)
	res, err := http.Get(url)

	body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}


	var f Forecast
	err = json.Unmarshal(body, &f)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	t := f.Temp.Temp * 9/5 - 459.67
	fmt.Println(`The temperature is`, t)
	fmt.Println(f)

	return &f, nil
}
```

**ioutil** and **json.Unmarshal** are essential in decoding our response JSON data in that API call.
First we feed in a zipcode as an argument, and also specify what the function will return. Then, we let **ioutil** read the response and set it equal to the variable "body" and also set a variable to catch and print any errors that might arise. Next we are setting a variable "f" equal to one of the **structs** we made earlier: Forcast. Finally, setting a variable to catch the final data that we want and returning it. 

```
func indexHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

    p := &Page{
        Welcome: "Welcome to GoLang!",
    }
    t, _ := template.ParseFiles("index.html")
    t.Execute(w,p)

}
 
func resultsHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Println(r.Method)
	fmt.Println(r.URL)

  	z := r.FormValue("zip")
  	fmt.Println(z)
	

    cast,err := getWeather(z)
    if err != nil{
    	fmt.Println(err) 
    }

    p := &Page{
        Temperature: int(cast.Temp.Temp * 9/5 - 459.67),
        Humidity: int(cast.Temp.Humidity),
        Max: int(cast.Temp.TempMax * 9/5 - 459.67),
        Min: int(cast.Temp.TempMin * 9/5 - 459.67),
    }
    t, _ := template.ParseFiles("results.html")
    t.Execute(w, p)
}

func main() {

	getWeather("10128")

	http.HandleFunc("/", indexHandler)

	http.HandleFunc("/results", resultsHandler)

	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
This is where the core functionality of the app lives. At the bottom, we are setting up the routes for our server and telling it to listen to port 8080. Back at the top, we have a function to handle the index route. This is where **"html/template"** comes in to help us bring data from the backend to the screen. Beneath, there is a **resultsHandler** that calls our API function given a ZIP by the user ("z := r.FormValue("zip"). Finally, we set a variable "p" that will follow our "page" **struct**. We set up a variable that we can catch on the front end using **"htm;/template"** and execute the response "t.Execute(w,p)" where "w" is the response and "p" is the data we are sending to the front end. 



```
<p> 
	Its is Currently
	<span class="number">	
		{{.Temperature}}
	</span> Degrees. 
	<br/>
	The Current Humidity is 
	<span class="number">
		{{.Humidity}}
	</span>% 
	<br/>
	The temperature today could reach a high of 
	<span class="number">
		{{.Max}}
	</span> 
	and a low of 
	<span class="number">
		{{.Min}}
	</span>
</p>

```

For templating, you have to import the "html/template" package and the style looks awfully similar to mustache in express, but it's not the same thing -- elements are denoted by a ".".
